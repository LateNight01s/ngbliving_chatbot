"Sometimes it happens that a tenant cannot pay his/her rent even after a reminder. After we have successfully warned the tenant, we transfer the outstanding claims from the rent to Allianz-Versicherungs AG, which thereby becomes the owner of the claims.

After the assignment of claims to Allianz-Versicherungs AG, defaulting tenants usually receive an email from Debeo GmbH, which was commissioned by Allianz-Versicherungs AG and informs the tenant about this process. From this point on, the tenant no longer owes the reminder rent to Medici Living but to Allianz-Versicherungs AG. The open rent can still be transferred to Medici Living GmbH, we will then ensure that Allianz-Versicherungs AG receives the money. Most importantly, the open rent is paid as soon 
as possible.

Debo GmbH supports the alliance in collecting all outstanding claims, taking into account the respective circumstances of the tenant. For example, a tenant who cannot pay his rent immediately can agree individual payment options with Debeo GmbH, which simplifies repayment of the outstanding amount.

You can find more information about debeo GmbH at: http://www.debeo.com/ or by email at info-mav@debeo.com .
